let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
// console.log(colors[13]); // This will result in an index error showing undefined:
// To fix this error, we need to make sure we are accessing an index that exists within the array. 
// In this case, we can change the index to 2, which is the last index of the array:
console.log(colors[2]);
// Now, when we run the corrected program, we get the expected output:
// blue
